From our modest beginnings, we quickly became synonymous with innovation and excellence, shaping a transformative legacy in the medical devices sector.",
  "aboutSection4Text21": "Strategic Growth & Relocation",
  "aboutSection4Text22": "1962 Recognising the necessity for enhanced distribution, we strategically relocated our operations to Agra (Uttar Pradesh), a centrally positioned hub in the country. 1967 We introduced our inaugural disposable medical device â€“ the non-sterile Nelaton Catheter (Urethral Catheter). This marked the beginning of our sporadic growth. Responding to the need to expand, our directors strategically established new units, each specialising in a unique range of products. This pivotal decision not only broadened our product portfolio but also addressed the growing market demand. The birth of Raj Vijay Corporation in the same year marked another milestone in our journey.",

In 1971, Romsons Junior India joined our ranks, specialising in Infusion Devices. By 1974, we pioneered India's first medical device sterilisation plant at BARC, Mumbai, revolutionising healthcare. Transitioning into a private limited company in 1977, we strategically withdrew from laboratory equipment to focus on medical devices. The momentum continued in 1984 as Romsons became the first in India to establish an in-house sterilisation plant, coinciding with the incorporation of Romsons Medicons. These strategic moves underscore our commitment to innovation and excellence.",
